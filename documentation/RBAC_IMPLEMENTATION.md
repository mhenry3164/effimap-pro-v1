# RBAC Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation requirements for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) across EffiMap Pro components.

## Core Components Requiring Updates

### Navigation Components
- [ ] `Sidebar.tsx`
  - Implement `PermissionGate` for menu items
  - Hide/show based on user roles and permissions
  - Consider division/branch scope for menu items

- [ ] `TopBar.tsx`
  - Gate administrative actions
  - Scope user management options

### Administrative Components
- [ ] `UserManagement.tsx`
  - Implement role assignment interface
  - Scope user listing based on permissions
  - Gate user creation/editing actions

- [ ] `OrganizationSettings.tsx`
  - Gate settings modifications
  - Implement feature flag controls
  - Scope visible settings by role

### Territory Management
- [ ] `TerritoryList.tsx`
  - Filter territories by user scope
  - Gate territory creation/editing
  - Implement ownership checks

- [ ] `TerritoryEditor.tsx`
  - Gate editing capabilities
  - Implement scoped modifications
  - Handle permission-based field access

### Division/Branch Management
- [ ] `DivisionManager.tsx`
  - Implement division-level permissions
  - Gate division creation/editing
  - Handle hierarchical access

- [ ] `BranchManager.tsx`
  - Implement branch-level permissions
  - Scope branch visibility
  - Handle division-based access

## Implementation Guidelines

### Using PermissionGate
```tsx
// Basic usage
<PermissionGate
  permission={{ resource: "territory", action: "manage" }}
  fallback={<ReadOnlyView />}
>
  <EditableView />
</PermissionGate>

// With context
<PermissionGate
  permission={{ resource: "branch", action: "manage" }}
  context={{ branchId, divisionId }}
>
  <BranchEditor />
</PermissionGate>
```

### Using Convenience Components
```tsx
// Managing resources
<CanManage resource="territory">
  <EditButton />
</CanManage>

// Reading resources
<CanRead resource="report">
  <ReportViewer />
</CanRead>
```

### Direct Permission Checks
```tsx
const { can, canManage } = useRBAC();

// Async permission check
const handleAction = async () => {
  if (await can('update', 'territory', { territoryId })) {
    // Proceed with action
  }
};
```

## Role-Specific Features

### Platform Admin
- Full system access
- Feature flag management
- Organization management
- User management across all organizations

### Organization Admin
- Organization-wide settings
- User management within organization
- Division/Branch creation and management
- Territory management

### Division Admin
- Division-specific settings
- Branch management within division
- Territory management within division
- User viewing within division

### Branch Admin
- Branch-specific settings
- Territory management within branch
- Limited user viewing

### Territory Manager
- Territory management (own territories)
- Basic reporting capabilities

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Implement permission checks in unit tests
- [ ] Test role inheritance
- [ ] Verify scope-based access
- [ ] Test component rendering based on permissions

## Security Considerations
- Always implement both client and server-side checks
- Verify scoped access on all operations
- Maintain audit logs for permission changes
- Regular permission verification in background processes
